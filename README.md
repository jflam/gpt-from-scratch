# gpt-from-scratch

My repo following along with Andrei Karpathy [GPT From Scratch Tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY).

The `bigram_m1` notebook uses the pytorch nightly builds with Metal acceleration for pytorch. Seems like a bit of a wash based on
informal analysis using the Bigram language model in the notebook. I hope it gets better with the actual Transformer model later.
